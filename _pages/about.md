I am humanoid robotics researcher and PhD student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca). I am a member of the [CERC in HCRMI](https://uwaterloo.ca/cerc-human-centred-robotics-machine-intelligence/) (Canada Excellence Research Chair in Human-Centred Robotics and Machine Intelligence) lab under the co-supervision of [Katja Mombaur](https://uwaterloo.ca/robohub/people-profiles/katja-mombaur) and [William Melek](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/profile/wmelek). My research focuses on humanoid whole-body motion generation and control using combined model-based and model-free approaches with [REEM-C](https://pal-robotics.com/robots/reem-c/) and [TALOS](https://pal-robotics.com/robots/talos/) humanoid robots by PAL Robotics.

Recently, I was a software engineering intern at [Apptronik](https://apptronik.com). My work focused on distributed reinforcement learning for bimanual manipulation. Seeing the final development and launch of the Apollo humanoid during my internship was certainly a highlight!

I was also a member of the HCRMI lab during my MASc where my research focused on benchmarking whole-body manipulation and loco-manipulation motions of humanoid robots as part of the [EUROBENCH project](https://eurobench2020.eu) using REEM-C. I developed an initial benchmark for whole-body manipulation and loco-manipulation tasks with the REEM-C. Additionally, I created a whole-body bimanual workspace analysis for two-handed manipulation of objects with REEM-C and TALOS.

I received a BASc in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Waterloo. During my BASc I had co-op work terms at a [ON Semiconductor](https://www.onsemi.com), the University of Waterloo's [EmRG](https://uwaterloo.ca/emerging-radio-systems-group/), [ATS Automation](https://atsautomation.com), [Powerhouse Controls](https://powerhouse.ca) and [Skyjack](https://www.skyjack.com) in roles ranging from RF engineering to controls systems design to CAD systems. -->

My goal is to have a career in humanoid robotics research in the area of whole-body motion and loco-manipulation. Humanoid robots offer the unique ability to operate in human designed spaces and I hope to use them to solve real-world problems.
