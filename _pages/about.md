I am humanoid robotics researcher and PhD student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca). I am a member of the [CERC in HCRMI](https://uwaterloo.ca/cerc-human-centred-robotics-machine-intelligence/) (Canada Excellence Research Chair in Human-Centred Robotics and Machine Intelligence) lab under the co-supervision of [Katja Mombaur](https://uwaterloo.ca/robohub/people-profiles/katja-mombaur) and [William Melek](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/profile/wmelek). My research focuses on humanoid whole-body motion generation and control using combined model-based and model-free approaches with [REEM-C](https://pal-robotics.com/robots/reem-c/) and [TALOS](https://pal-robotics.com/robots/talos/) humanoid robots by PAL Robotics.

My goal is to have a career in humanoid robotics research in the area of whole-body motion and loco-manipulation. Humanoid robots offer the unique ability to operate in human designed spaces and I hope to use them to solve real-world problems.
