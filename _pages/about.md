I am humanoid robotics researcher and MASc student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca). I am a member of the [CERC in HCRMI](https://uwaterloo.ca/cerc-human-centred-robotics-machine-intelligence/) (Canada Excellence Research Chair in Human-Centred Robotics and Machine Intelligence) lab under the supervision of [Katja Mombaur](https://uwaterloo.ca/robohub/people-profiles/katja-mombaur). My research focuses on benchmarking whole-body manipulation and loco-manipulation motions of humanoid robots as part of the [EUROBENCH project](https://eurobench2020.eu) using the (REEM-C robot)[https://pal-robotics.com/robots/reem-c/] by PAL Robotics.

Prior to my MASc studies, I received a BASc in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Waterloo. During my BASc I had co-op work terms at a [ON Semiconductor](https://www.onsemi.com), the University of Waterloo's [EmRG](https://uwaterloo.ca/emerging-radio-systems-group/), [ATS Automation](https://atsautomation.com), [Powerhouse Controls](https://powerhouse.ca) and [Skyjack](https://www.skyjack.com) in roles ranging from RF engineering to controls systems design to CAD systems.

I hope to continue a career in humanoid robotics research to solve complex manipulation and locomotion that these robots provide the unique ability to perform with the hopes to see them realized in real-world applications.
